# Phase 1 — War Cards Forge

## Purpose

This workspace exists to forge and stabilize the core pressure grammar of SHAGI Phase 1.

Phase 1 is a mechanics foundry.

It exists to:

- Establish a minimal, stable war card schema
- Prove countdown-based tension
- Prove sacrifice mechanics
- Prove cooperative stress
- Produce small operational Genesis decks
- Determine Phase 1 survivability

This workspace builds engines — not lore.

## Scope

This workspace is strictly limited to:

- Genesis Decks (The Ignition Triangle)
- Early grammar stabilization
- Tight, minimal prototypes
- Ultra-contained mechanical iteration

Phase 1 is a crossing.

It begins with departure.
It ends with landing.
Nothing beyond that boundary is authorized here.

---

## Explicit Non-Scope

The following are prohibited inside this workspace:

- Infrastructure integration
- Filesystem integration beyond local prototype files
- Cloud / Azure interaction
- Citadel systems
- Governance architecture
- Canon tier promotion
- Phase restructuring
- Meta-layer expansion
- Moonbase construction
- Continental campaign logic

If a feature requires any of the above,
it does not belong in Phase 1.

---

## Design Constraints

Phase 1 operates under the following locked decisions:

- Card schema: Fixed
- Field count: 5 numeric fields
- No descriptive flavor fields
- Card types: Closed set
- No emergent card types during Phase 1
- No new architectural tiers

Genesis → Stabilize → Test → Iterate.

No inflation.
No abstraction creep.

---

## Working Principle

Build small.
Test tension.
Adjust.
Repeat.

If tension is not survivable,
we redesign.

If tension survives,
Phase 2 becomes viable.

This workspace is a forge.

Not a cathedral.
Not a constitution.
Not a civilization.

Forge first.
